# GNN-for-Collision-Prediction

This work explors the use of a GNN to perform collision prediction of trajectories. 

The simulation can be run using the following command 

```
python3 run_Linearized_VO.py
```

The results of the prediction would be stored in the folder named *Plots*  the resulting images can be converted to a video for ease of visulization using the below command 


```
python3 Image2Video.py
```
